# Simple Calculator in C

This project is a basic C program that simulates a simple calculator.  
It performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** based on user input.

## Features
- Menu-driven calculator
- Takes two integer inputs from the user
- Supports four arithmetic operations
- Uses `switch-case` for operation selection

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter two integer values.
2. A menu is displayed with available operations.
3. The user selects an operation by entering a choice (1–4).
4. The result is displayed on the screen.
