# Sum of Elements in Rows and Columns (2D Array)

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on calculating the **sum of elements of each row and each column** in a 2D array. It helps in understanding how matrix data can be processed row-wise and column-wise using nested loops.

---

## 🎯 Aim  
To design a program that reads a 2D array from the user and finds the **sum of every row and every column**.

---

## 📖 Description  
The program accepts the number of rows and columns from the user and stores elements in a 2D array. It then traverses the matrix to calculate:  
- the sum of each individual row  
- the sum of each individual column  

This operation is useful in data analysis, matrix operations, and basic numerical computations.

## 🧠 Concepts Used  
- Two-dimensional arrays  
- Nested loops  
- Row-wise traversal  
- Column-wise traversal  

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle  
- Input matrix dimensions  
- Store values in a 2D array  
- Traverse rows to compute row sums  
- Traverse columns to compute column sums  
- Display the calculated results
