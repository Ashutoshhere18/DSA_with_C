# Transpose of a 2D Array

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates a C program that calculates the **transpose of a 2D array**.  
The transpose of a matrix is formed by **interchanging its rows and columns**. This is a fundamental operation in matrix processing and is widely used in computer science, mathematics, and data handling applications.

## 🎯 Aim  
To develop a program that accepts a 2D array from the user and displays its **transpose**.

---

## 📖 Description  
The program takes the number of rows and columns from the user and allows them to enter elements of a 2D array. It then processes the matrix by swapping rows with columns and generates a new matrix known as the **transpose matrix**.

In a transpose operation:  
- Rows become columns  
- Columns become rows

## 🧠 Concept Used  
- 2D Arrays  
- Nested loops  
- Matrix traversal  
- Index swapping technique  

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle  
- Input matrix dimensions  
- Store elements in a 2D array  
- Generate a new matrix where element positions are swapped  
- Display the transposed matrix
