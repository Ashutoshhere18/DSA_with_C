# String Length Using Pointer in C

## 📌 Description
This program calculates the **length of a string using pointers** in C.  
Instead of using built-in functions like `strlen()`, the program manually traverses the string using a pointer until it reaches the null character (`'\0'`).

This helps in understanding:
- Pointer traversal
- String termination in C
- Function calls using pointers

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- GCC Compiler (or any standard C compiler)

## ✅ Sample Output

```
Enter String :
Hello World
Length of string is 11
```

---

## 📖 Key Learning

* `char *str` points to the first character of the string
* Pointer moves forward using `str++`
* Loop ends when `'\0'` (null character) is found
